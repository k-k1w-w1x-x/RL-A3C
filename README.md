The homework for BIT's RL course.Improved A3C with UCB and history weight allocator,randomized workers' learning rate,and using KL-divergence to control the exploration.We also tried using attention mechanism to improve the performance of the agent.
Clone from [pytorch-a3c](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a3c),implemented our own version of A3C.
